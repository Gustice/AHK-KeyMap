# AHK-KeyMap

Helper for fast access to symbols

## Purpose

If you struggle like me to put symbols in your documents and just find the Windows Symbol Table not this useful AutoHotkey might be an option for you.

This script solves exactly that issue an helps you to reach your most frequent Symbols by Sensitive Strings or Hotkeys.

## Usage

If you already have AutoHotkey installed you can clone the project or download *KeyMap.ahk* and *KeyMap.help* (which is actually a .txt).  If you don't use AutoHotkey already you can just download the released KeyMap.exe. 

The script starts by Clicking on the KeyMap.exe/ahk. You will notice a small new icon in your System tray

Now you can already use the defined Hotkeys and Hotstrings:

1. Type `#dia` in some file to get 'Ø' (`#dia` is the HotString here)
2. Hit *AltGr+A* to get `α` (This is obviously the HotKey)

## Defined Functions

You can open the file *KeyMap.ahk* in order to see the defined functions. If you are using the *KeyMap.exe* you can start a help dialogue by right click on the Tray icon an then select *Show Help*. This will open a text file that shows you all defined Features partially with comments.
